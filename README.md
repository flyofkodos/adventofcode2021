# Advent of Code 2021

My hacky solutions for the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) puzzles.  

## Notes:  

* These are done quickly to get the job done, best practice and readability may suffer.  
* Most will be in C# since that's what I tend to think in. Other languages may come as time / boredom allows.  
* Code will be pushed to the main branch. Yes, I know I should use the develop -> feature -> main workflow...  

## Todos  

* Unit tests.  
* Maybe create single projects for each language and add each day's code as a module?  
* Documentation.  
* Enfore proper gates in the dev pipeline.
