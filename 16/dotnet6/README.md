# Advent of Code Day 16  

The C# version of the solution for the [Advent of Code 2021 day 1 puzzle](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/16)  

## Design  

### Part 1  

This code just looops through each packet and totals the version number.  
Could be changed to a generic algorithm, List of with a packet class returned and the versions summed.  

### Part 2  

Still being worked on.  

## TODO

* Part 2 code
